            Ask older relatives to recall their children when they were very young, and they’ll probably struggle to remember more than a few key moments.  Of course they’ll remember the big events, and certainly they’ll have many photographs of what they actually looked like – we’re always grabbing the phone or camera and trying to get them to look at us.</p>
            <p>The one thing most parents of older children will say though is how fast those first couple of years goes.  There’s nothing more carefree than very small children, and family life during that time.  Everything is an adventure, every day brings new discoveries – and it’s this story board of life that we capture in documentary family photography – and baby portraits are about so much more than the fleeting changes in how they look.</p>
            <p>When you book with Mulberry, there will probably be a family portrait of course, but also the moments that will transport you back to these days.  The tight grasp of your newborn on your finger, the uncontrollable giggle of your baby as they are thrown in the air, the wonder of a butterfly landing on the hand of your toddler, the delight of your child as they run around catching bubbles, splashing in puddles, flying on swings.</p>
            <p>Family life</p>
            <p>Babies and small children won’t stop for the camera, and that’s fine with us – naps and meals and quiet times are all part of their day and we’ll capture that too.  We work around their routine, not the other way round.  We start off the portrait session in the familiar surroundings of your home, documenting your child’s normal morning routine.  Weather permitting, we’ll move outside and have a fun morning filled with play and interaction with you.  Our goal is to make your family portrait session enjoyable and relaxed, with minimal direction and posing.</p>
            <p>Suggested activities</p>
            <p>Apart from their normal routines, all the things you’d normally do with your baby or toddler you could plan to do on the morning that we’re with you.  For babies this might be reading a picture book together, splashing in bubble bath, tummy time, playing with their favourite toys.  For toddlers a walk through the leaves, playing on the swings, finger painting, playing with bubbles.</p>
            <p>We have lots of ideas, let us know if you’d like more when you book your session.</p>
            <p>Your family portrait session from start to finish</p>
            <p>Contact us to book your family portrait session – we cover London and the surrounding counties.  Your viewing session will take place a few days after your portrait session, and again we’ll come to you – you’ll be able to view all of the photos from our morning together on our high quality screen and you’ll also be able to see our high quality, bespoke product range so that you can decide how best to display and record your photographs.</p>

          <![CDATA[<div style="word-wrap:normal;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;">
          The focus of many children’s portraits is on very young children, but as they get older and their personalities emerge and separate from their parents – that’s a wonderful, endlessly fun time.  It’s at this age that you can see the adult they will one day be start to emerge.  Sporty and active, quiet, thoughtful, kind, intrigued, noisy – most older kids and teens are all of these and more in one day. <p></p>
          <p>It’s also the time when your job as parents is at its most rewarding – you’ve already cared for them when they were totally dependent on you, but they haven’t yet found their place in the world.  It’s a time when they will explore and discover, trying out different things to decide what they love.  The relationship shifts to one of guidance as they explore independently, to a time of understanding who they are – and, in the case of teens, to them discovering who you are too.</p>
          <p>The things that your child will love most at seven, ten, fifteen will either become a lifelong passion or tried and discarded.  Either way, documenting these years will provoke much laughter and nostalgia later on.  “Remember when you loved ballet, animals and drawing and you wanted to be a dancer – but you became a vet, even though you look squeamish here when you found a snail in the garden”.  “You were idealistic back then, you put a blue streak in your hair right before the portrait session and you only really wanted to play music – who’d have thought you’d be working hard at your physics degree a few years later”.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>A moment in time</strong>
          </p>
          <p>We’re really interested in the lives of children, what it is that they love and how that shapes who they are.  Every child and teen is different, and it’s important to reflect this in your family portraits.  The true benefit of documentary portraits becomes apparent with this age group – self conscious if they are in a formal portrait environment, but natural when they are free to just be themselves.  Our aim with this age group is to let that emerge from the portrait session.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested activities</strong>
          </p>
          <p>With older kids, the possibilities are endless.  A go-karting track, a rugby pitch, a picnic, a long walk with the dog, climbing trees.  All of the things they love doing with you as a family.  We once photographed a family on GCSE results day (from leaving in the morning, arriving at college, opening the envelope, celebratory lunch), but you’d need a very cooperative teen for that!  We have lots of ideas, please contact us for suggestions.</p>

            <div style="word-wrap:normal;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;">I come from a large family, I’m one of five kids.  As we’ve all grown and had families of our own, the immediate family group – grandparents, adult kids, their spouses and kids – has grown to 24 people.  Until a few years ago, there were great-grandparents too.  You can imagine the logistics of trying to get everyone together for a group photo.  We managed it about 3 years ago, but we probably won’t do it again for another 20 years.<p></p>
            <p>A family portrait session is the perfect time to get everyone together to do just that.  Part of your session can include grandparents too – in fact, we’d encourage it.  Either a formal family grouping in the park, or everyone getting involved in an activity – it’s a once-in-a-generation event.</p>
            <p>The relationship between kids and grandparents can be very special.  No matter what age your children, no matter how old they get – grandma and grandad will probably be their favourite people in the world (even more than you sometimes!).  A collection that shows this relationship will be magical as your child grows, and it will treasured for many generations to come.</p>
            <p><strong>The family tree</strong></p>
            <p>If your family is young, the generations will probably be quite small – you, the kids, grandparents and aunts and uncles.  A few years down the line, there’ll be more kids added, extra spouses, great-grandchildren.  It’s wonderful to record these growing branches of the family tree, to point out to kids the baby who is now a teenager, how distinguished grandad has become, how many new cousins have arrived.  These are the pictures that are pored over, and will intrigue your children and future generations.</p>
